## Contact Us [#contact]

Answers to many common questions are readily available on this event’s
website. If you cannot find the answer to your question, you are welcome
to contact us by emailing graphql_events@linuxfoundation.org.

## Confidentiality

We never sell attendee lists or contact information, nor do we authorize
others to do so. If you receive an email claiming to sell an attendee
list for a Linux Foundation event, please forward it to events@linuxfoundation.org.

## Code of Conduct [#codeofconduct]

The GraphQL Foundation and the Linux Foundation are dedicated to
providing a harassment-free experience for participants at all of our
events, whether they are held in person or virtually. GraphQLConf is a
working conference intended for professional networking and
collaboration within the open source community. It exists to encourage
the open exchange of ideas and expression and requires an environment
that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. While at
GraphQLConf or related ancillary or social events, any participants,
including members, speakers, attendees, volunteers, sponsors,
exhibitors, booth staff and anyone else, should not engage in
harassment in any form.

This Code of Conduct may be revised at any time by The GraphQL
Foundation or The Linux Foundation and the terms are non-negotiable.
Your registration for or attendance at GraphQL, whether in person or
virtually, indicates your agreement to abide by this policy and its
terms.

Please read the full [Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct) for the complete policy and terms.

## Diversity & Inclusion [#dni]

Education and collaboration are vital to the future of the open source
ecosystem, and it is imperative to us that everyone in the community
that wants to participate feels welcome to do so regardless of gender,
gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, age,
religion or economic status. Our [code of conduct](#codeofconduct) outlines our expectations
for all those who participate in our community, as well as the
consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We offer diversity and have considered a broad
range of both [onsite resources](#onsite-resources) and
[emergency resources](#emergency-resources) as well as a
[health & safety](#health-and-safety) policy.

If you have ideas on how we can create a more inclusive event, please
do not hesitate to let us know. Contact Emily Ruf, Event Director, at eruf@linuxfoundation.org.
